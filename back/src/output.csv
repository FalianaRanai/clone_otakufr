Kawamori designed the case that will ship alongside the Wena Wrist product. The watch itself is a mechanical design, evoking pilot watch-style elements. The dial's design evokes the attitude indicator/artificial horizon seen on fighter instrument panels, with one side being an open-heart design showing the mechanical movement. The 12:00 position is indicated by a white arrow, common to many pilot watches.

Despite this rather bleak scenario, there are still some schools with teams trying to keep the sport alive. With that, glimmers of hope are starting to appear.

Having played for the boys' soccer club when she was in middle school, Nozomi Onda's skills are nothing less than prodigious. Because of this, she thinks that playing soccer with fellow girls would only drag her down. She is only motivated to play her best when facing those she deems worthy opponents. Meanwhile, Sumire Suou is a promising rookie with exceptional talent—a talent hindered by a team that cannot keep up with her abilities.

Onda, convinced by her former coach to join a girls' soccer club, and Suou, accompanied by her close friend and rival Midori Soshizaki, cross paths as members of the Warabi Seinan High School's girls' soccer team. In this new field, both girls begin to display their full potential and skills.

The line between doing plagiarism and doing a homage seems ambiguous, and the truth is that that line doesn't exist anywhere. It holds true even when the role is reversed. A homage holds a great risk of becoming plagiarism. The lyrics to this song pays homage to Ozaki Housai's haiku and his final years of life.

This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.

But instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world—one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker ""Shadow"" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination.

"Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu";"Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut";"月とライカと吸血姫";"Fantasy, Sci-Fi";"On November 23, 1957, the whole world witnessed the Federal Republic of Zirnitra's monumental achievement of sending the first live animal—a dog—to outer space. Since then, the space race between the confederacy and its competitor, the United Kingdom of Arnack, has intensified; the two countries hope to one day send humans to the cosmos above.

As a dog's biology is inherently different from a human's anatomy, there is no way to perfectly identify the risks involving space travel and its effects on an individual's body without actually sending someone for observation. However, Zirnitra's government has a potential solution: to experiment on vampires, whose biological similarity to humans is too significant to ignore.

Despite being forcibly taken from her home in the mountains, vampire Irina Luminesk shows no resistance and is even willing to train as a test subject. Lev Leps, a former top candidate to become the first human cosmonaut, is designated to accompany Irina and act as her guide. Through their time together, Irina and Lev begin to develop a mutual love for outer space, bringing them closer together.";"TV";"12";"2021/10/04";"2021.0";"Finished Airing";"Shogakukan, BS Japan, Bandai Namco Arts, ADK Marketing Solutions";"Funimation, Travel Compass";"Arvo Animation";"Light novel";"23";"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/118374.jpg"

With these cards, people can access the hidden power of the ""buddy"" that can be found within themselves.

There is a secret group of players called High Card, who have been directly ordered by the king of Fourland to collect the cards that have been scattered throughout the kingdom while moonlighting as employees of the luxury carmaker Pinochle. Scouted to become the group's fifth member, Finn soon joins the players on a dangerous mission to find these cards.

""All you need in life are manners, dignity, and the will to bet on your own life.""

However, Who's Who, the rival car maker obsessed with defeating Pinochle, and the Klondikes, the infamous Mafia family, stand in the way of the gang. A frenzied battle amongst these card-obsessed players, fueled by justice, desire, and revenge, is about to begin!

Are you ready? It's Showdown!!

A wedding is being held at Shibuya Hikarie, where Sato is dressed in a wedding dress. While Conan and the other invited guests are watching, an assailant suddenly bursts in, and Takagi, who was trying to protect Sato, is injured. Takagi survived and the situation was settled, but in Sato's eyes, the image of the grim reaper that she had seen when Jinpei Matsuda, the man she had been in love with, had been killed in a series of bombings three years ago, overlapped with Takagi's.

At the same time, the perpetrator of the bombings escapes from prison. Rei Furuya/Toru Amuro, a member of the public safety police, is hunting down the man who killed his classmate, but a mysterious person in disguise suddenly appears and puts a collar bomb on him.

Conan visits the underground shelter where Amuro is hiding out to disarm the collar bomb, and hears about an incident three years ago when he and his now deceased classmates from the police academy encountered an unidentified virtual bomber named ""Plamya"" in Shibuya. As Conan and his team investigate, a disturbing shadow begins to loom over them.

The event triggers Aileen's memories from her past life—she has been reincarnated in an otome game as the villainess, who is destined to die in the final act. To prevent her predetermined demise, Aileen has only one option: to court the game's last boss, Claude Jeanne Elmir—the proclaimed ""Demon King"" and Cedric's half-brother—and marry him.

However, it is easier said than done, as Claude distrusts her intentions. Instead of giving up, Aileen adamantly tries to win his heart by helping Claude fulfill his wish: to build peace between humankind and demonic beasts.

Once a fairy has been stripped of a wing, whoever possesses it holds the fairy's life in their hands.

"Tae-il";"Chun Tae-il";"태일이";"Drama, Slice of Life";"Chun Taeil was an assistant who once bought bread for hungry girls working in factories; a tailor who could not turn a blind eye to the poor working conditions in Pyeonghwa Market; and a worker who had no choice but to shout to defend the Labor Standards Act. 

Instead of honoring Chun Taeil as a patriotic martyr, Chun Tae-il deals with his personality and destiny. It depicts the eldest son, who had to be the pillar of a poor family, and a worker who had no choice but to set fire to the labor movement by collaborating with his colleagues, who did not even know how to protest. At the same time, the film depicts the scenery and characters of the more lyrical time in which Chun Taeil lived. 

Chun Tae-il is a detailed portrait of the people who wanted to live like human beings in impossible times presented as a painful and beautiful animated film. The voice actors include actors Jang Dongyoon as Chun; Yeom Hyeran as Chun′s mother, Lee Sosun; and Jin Seonkyu; Park Chulmin; and Kwon Haehyo. (HONG Eunmi)

Piracy"" clip featuring the characters from the Sgt. Frog anime franchise has been produced.

MAGP was launched in July 2013 in order for manga publishers and animation-related companies to cross-sectionally share information on piracy in Japan and abroad, investigate the actual situation, and take countermeasures. This new ""Stop! Piracy"" video was produced to inform the public that the illegal downloading of infringing content, which was previously limited to movies and music works, now covers all copyrighted works due to the revised Copyright Act, which came into effect on January 1, 2021. The clip will be screened in 75 theaters in the Kanto area from December 24.

At a single touch, they are pulled from their lonely lives into a wondrous castle straight out of a Grimm's fairy tale. This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.

As time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice.

There, he meets the brash Ritsuko Akine who begins to play the violin in the room, believing she is alone. However, following a past incident, there have been rumors claiming that Akine is a bully, which has isolated her from her peers—a fact Aono was unaware of.

Akine dreams of enrolling in a school with an orchestra, but her amateurish playing and lack of musical knowledge grates on Aono immensely. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity for the two to become friends, their teacher suggests that Aono teaches Akine how to play the violin, something Aono is vehemently against. However, as the pair spends more time together, they soon learn to understand and help each other—and Aono may finally discover the lost passion and melody in his life.";"TV";"24";"2023/04/09";"2023.0";"Currently Airing";"NHK, NHK Enterprises";"UNKNOWN";"Nippon Animation";"Web manga";"25";"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1832/133754.jpg"

Two years ago, this connection had led to him receiving a spiritual injury on his right hand, with his friend getting caught in the crossfire. The event caused him to become a shut-in, leaving him with very poor social skills. Fortunately, Keitarou is slowly starting to mingle with society, thanks to the help of his childhood friend, Eiko Houzuki.

As part of his rehabilitation, Keitarou takes on the part-time job of a private tutor, and his first pupil is none other than Eiko's cousin, Yayoi Houzuki.

Due to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard.

Unlike other high school girls, Anzu has no time for or interest in romance. But as she begins playing a poorly programmed 3D otome game, a bizarre flying wizard named Riri emerges from the screen and calls Anzu ""subject one,"" the first person who will experience a dating game harem storyline in real life.

Despite Anzu's fiery protests, Riri confiscates her favorite things to force her to focus on love.

As all the ridiculous fabricated scenarios help Anzu warm up to Tsukasa's pleasant nature, Riri throws other stereotypical pretty boys her way—and avoiding romance quickly becomes almost impossible.";"ONA";"12";"2022/10/27";"2022.0";"Finished Airing";"Shueisha, Netflix";"UNKNOWN";"domerica";"Manga";"26";"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1676/128173.jpg"
